# KSPWarp
Travel all the way across the universe in no time!

A Kerbal Space Program mod in developement.

Please feel free to help me with it. Post mod-related issues if you have some, give me feedback. I'd appreciate it.

## How?
Copy the content of the `GameData` folder in your game's `GameData` folder and enjoy :)

## What and Why?
### What?
This is the project of a KSP mod which messes with the in-game time warps.
It basically replaces the time warp rates on-demand with the following rates :
```
Basic (stock) : {x1, x5,  x10,  x50,   x100,    x1000,    x10 000,    x100 000}

Super :         {x1, x10, x50,  x100,  x1 000,  x10 000,  x100 000,   x200 000}

Ultra :         {x1, x50, x100, 1 000, x10 000, x100 000, x200 000, x500 000}
```
To avoid vessel explosion and/or collision with planets, I disable the collisions check while on very high speed (x200 000 and x 500 000).

It's the same as pressing ALT+F12 and checking the "No crash damage" checkbox.

### Why?
I often watch a french KSP streamer do his magic and he complained a lot about loooong trips. That's why! :D
